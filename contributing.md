# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included courses before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Every course addition should follow the same format.
	1. The course should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
- If you want to add notes to a course, add it below the course as subdashed point.
- Please add a short description of the course after the course name where it is appropriate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- You can also add other related websites and repositories in the end.
